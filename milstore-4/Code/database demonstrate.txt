He has been elected MP for this riding since 1993. Goodale previously served as the leader of the provincial Liberal Party, but began his federal political career in 1974 as the MP for the rural constituency of Assiniboia. He was born in Wilcox, and has lived in the Regina area his whole life.</p><p> 	He says the Liberal government is looking to keep Canada stable by creating jobs, and keeping the country peaceful, inclusive and generous during a “very uncertain time” on the world stage.</p><p> 	“The Canadian position is strong, it can’t be taken for granted it needs careful attention and that’s what we need to do in the years going forward. Make sure that we preserve what is so good and strong and successful about Canada,” said Goodale.</p><p> 	Goodale mentioned lowering middle class tax rates, and incentives for energy efficient residences as two federal policies that could help families in Regina-Wascana.</p><p> 	Specific to the constituency, he added he would like create a successor for the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration to protect water security in the province, expand Farm Credit Canada developing around the headquarters in Regina, and designate the RCMP Heritage Centre a national museum to encourage education about the RCMP and bring in more tourism revenue to the city.</p><p> 	Goodale said these parts of his platform can help tackle “those issues that really can bring jobs and growth and success and prosperity to this community.”</p> | <p> 	<a href="https://rgoodale.liberal.ca/" target="_blank">Liberal: Ralph Goodale</a></p>                  |

He was born and raised in Regina, and has been working in the city as a software developer for the last 17 years.</p><p> 	Kram says economic issues are at the top of his priorities heading into the federal election.</p><p> 	“We certainly need to cancel the carbon tax and have a greater deal of affordability for your average working class Canadians,” said Kram. “Getting back to balanced budgets is something that we need to do. We have to stop mortgaging our children’s future, and we can’t be running deficits until forever and a day.”</p><p> 	He also emphasized the need for the continued growth of Saskatchewan’s natural resources through the further development of pipelines. Kram says this is a key issue for some in this riding that he has spoken to that work in the resource sector, and the province would have more funding for other areas of government with that additional revenue coming in.</p><p> 	“In any given year between 10 and 15 per cent of the provincial government’s budget comes from natural resource royalties, and when those resources are not getting to market it affects everyone, especially provincial government employees come collective bargaining time,” said Kram.</p> | <p> 	<a href="https://www.michaelkram2019.ca/" target="_blank">Conservative: Michael Kram</a></p>           |

She says that not much else can get done until those issues are handled.</p><p> 	She thinks Regina-Wascana could benefit from a fresh pair of eyes.</p><p> 	“There are a lot of people working coal and oil and gas [jobs], and we want to allocated dollars to local communities and [these] workers to help transition their valuable skill set away from the oil economy to the green economy.”</p> | <p> 	<a href="https://www.greenparty.ca/en/riding/2013-47009" target="_blank">Green: Tamela Friesen</a></p> |
